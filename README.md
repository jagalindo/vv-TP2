# TP2 vv
Here you will find the material for the second Tp of the Testing Course which copes with the generation of mocks for stubbing and interaction testing.

The objective of this lab session is to understand what it means to testmultiple inter-dependent classes. This goes from the realization of a test plan to the use of mocks for stubbing and interaction testing.
